      <h1>story of my life</h1>
      <p class="datum">09/20/2018</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>I was around 12 years old when I taught myself how to code. Over time I’ve started making apps for WindowsPhone and then even for iOS. Maybe you could’ve even downloaded some of my apps. I had 2 apps that made it to the App Store - the first one was called “What to wear today?” (pretty self-explanatory) and the other one was an app that my classmates felt in love with. Mainly because it was an app that made cheating in school super easy.</p>

<p>After some time, I started getting into web development a lot + I landed my first real full-stack developer job when I was 15 years old. That experience really shaped my coding skills into a form where I was totally able to deliver for a client. Later that year, I finally realized it’s totally possible to make some money off of it. That’s the moment where my freelancer career started. Since then, I’ve been working on multiple projects for my clients and on side hustles like (Tashmoo, Lanistae, Arkun, etc.). Meanwhile, I really got into social media marketing and cryptocurrencies (I became a day-trader for 2 months). That all lasted for about 2 years until I had to stop it all.</p>

<p>That’s because I went to the USA to study for a year. That year was a big change in my life, not just because of the skills I gained but I think I finally found out what I really wanna focus on in the future. During my stay there I rebranded “this one project of mine” that later became PalmMedia. I also discovered podcasting and my interest in social media marketing became the main thing I now focus on.</p>

<p>Right after I came back to the Czech Republic I’ve been spending all my time and energy on PalmMedia - working for clients, creating original content, strategizing, etc. Right now, my main goal is to grow its awareness and make it a well-known brand amongst as many people in the niche it operates.</p>
